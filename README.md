# Neville's algorithm
Neville's algorithm is an algorithm used for polynomial interpolation that was derived by the mathematician Eric Harold Neville. Given n + 1 points, there is a unique polynomial of degree â‰¤ n which goes through the given points. Neville's algorithm evaluates this polynomial.
